## Description

This Python program implements the classical **Columnar Transposition Cipher**.  
The plaintext is written into a grid row-wise and then read out column-wise using a user-defined column key.

### Features

- Encrypts and decrypts using a custom column order  
- User inputs the key as e.g. `0,3,2,1`  
- Automatic padding with `X` if the text doesn't fit evenly

### How to run

```bash
python3 spaltentranspo.py
```
